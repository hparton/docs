# Pull Requests

If you have your code on a branch you will want to get it back into the 'master' branch. This should only happen once the new code changes have been tested through QA. To find out how to view a site on QA view: [http://docs.exposecms.com/docs/laravel-testing-qa-sites](http://docs.exposecms.com/docs/laravel-testing-qa-sites)

To create a Pull Request (PR) you will use Bitbucket to select your branch and your target branch you want the changes to merged into. It is better to use a Pull Request rather than doing it locally with 'git merge'. This is because you can see the differences and view possible conflicts before merging.

It is good to add another developer as a reviewer of your changes to have a second look to ensure there are no issues.
